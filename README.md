# Welcome to the Space Agency website!

This website is a fully fictional representation of a space agency, containing both humorous and serious information about space, spacecraft, and space travel. It was built using React and several additional libraries and tools:

- React: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Framer Motion: a library for adding animations to React components
- Bootstrap: a front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites
- React Router: a library for adding routing to React apps

The website was deployed using Netlify, a platform for hosting static websites.

If you want to run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

The website will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Here's what you can do on the website:

- Explore information about space and space travel at [/information](/information).
